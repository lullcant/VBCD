# Code Repository for MICCAI 2025 Submission

## Repository Overview

During the review phase, we are providing the implementation code for our model, tooth position prompt, CMPL loss..., to facilitate a clearer understanding of our methodology. Additionally, we have included sample data for reference. 
Due to anonymity requirements, we are unable to provide the pretrained model with external link to online drive at this time.   
We plan to open-source the training and inference code, pretrained model checkpoints etc. after the paper is published
